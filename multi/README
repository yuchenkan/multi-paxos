The goal of this demo is to create an easy-to-build
third-part-library-free paxos implementation with minimized code,
optimization and idealized irrelevant runtime environment, which can
be used to verify the whole system behaviour under different simulated
circumstances like network faliure and process crash.

Membership management are added but not used.

Run with:
  make
  cp debug.conf.simple debug.conf
  bash run.sh
